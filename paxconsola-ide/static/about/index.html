        <h1>About Pax Consola</h1>
        <a>Pax Consola is being presented at the <a
                href="https://vcfed.org/wp/festivals/vintage-computer-festival-east/classes/">Vintage Computer
                Festival East</a> in 2021.</p>
            <p>Developed by <a href="http://timryan.org">Tim Ryan</a>.</p>
            <h2>How to use Pax Consola</h2>
            <p>paxconsola.com consists of a single-pane coding input and an emulator sidebar. You are
                able to write a program in <a href="http://github.com/tcr/paxconsola/">Pax Forth</a> (a
                simple Forth dialect) that can run on many different vintage computers and consoles. The
                underlying graphics system is implemented for many different machines, so you only need to
                write your game or script once.</p>
            <p>After modifying the code,
                use the sidebar on the right to select which console you'd like to run the game on.</p>
            <p></p>
            <h1>Credits</h1>
            <p>Pax Consola is inspired by the BASIC systems and Game Maker programs I spent hours on
                as a kid. As well as my dad, who helped me appreciate how fun it is to build new things.
            </p>
            <p>Pax Forth was inspired in part by <a href="https://github.com/larsbrinkhoff/nybbleForth">Lars
                    Brinkhoff's nybbleForth</a> stack machine.</p>
            <p>I credit learning Forth from the tutorial for <a href="https://skilldrick.github.io/easyforth/">Easy
                    Forth by Nick Morgan</a>, which the
                Snake game was derived from.</p>
            <p>Pax Consola uses the Emularity emulator system from <a href="https://github.com/db48x/emularity">The
                    Internet
                    Archive</a> as well as <a href="https://wasmboy.app/">WasmBoy</a>.</p>
