# About Pax Consola

Pax Consola is being presented at the <a
href="https://vcfed.org/wp/festivals/vintage-computer-festival-east/classes/">Vintage Computer
Festival East</a> in 2021.

Developed by <a href="http://timryan.org">Tim Ryan</a>.

## How to use Pax Consola

paxconsola.com consists of a single-pane coding input and an emulator sidebar. You are
able to write a program in <a href="http://github.com/tcr/paxconsola/">Pax Forth</a> (a
simple Forth dialect) that can run on many different vintage computers and consoles. The
underlying graphics system is implemented for many different machines, so you only need to
write your game or script once.

After modifying the code, use the sidebar on the right to select which console you'd like to run the game on.

## Credits

Pax Consola is inspired by the BASIC systems and Game Maker programs I spent hours on
as a kid. As well as my dad, who helped me appreciate how fun it is to build new things.

Pax Forth was inspired in part by <a href="https://github.com/larsbrinkhoff/nybbleForth">Lars
Brinkhoff's nybbleForth</a> stack machine.

The tutorial for <a href="https://skilldrick.github.io/easyforth/">Easy
Forth by Nick Morgan</a> is also an introduction to the default
Snake game.

Pax Consola uses the Emularity emulator system from <a href="https://github.com/db48x/emularity">The
Internet Archive</a> as well as <a href="https://wasmboy.app/">WasmBoy</a>.
