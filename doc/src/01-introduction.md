# Introduction

Pax Consola is a development environment for games that run on vintage computers and video game
consoles.

Using the online IDE at http://paxconsola.com, you can write a game that runs on a bunch of many
early home computers and consoles at once. Currently Pax Consola makes it easy to write a game for
these platforms:

* Commodore 64
* Gameboy
* DOS

More consoles may be supported in the future. Pax Consola also supports an in-browser environment targeting WebAssembly.
