# Game Examples

There are built-in examples to demonstrate what types of games you can build with Pax Consola.

## Example: Snake World

Like the Nokia cell phone game. Snake World is based directly on [Easy Forth by skilldrick](https://skilldrick.github.io/easyforth/)
which has a great tutorial for getting introduced to Forth.

Snake is a perfect example game. It can run in-memory even without optimization, which can result in
a binary too large to run on some systems. It also runs on fully text-based engines. Meanwhile, the
game is simple and still easy to customize.

## Example: Fork World

A text adventure game.

## Example: Sword World

A WIP top-down role-playing game.
