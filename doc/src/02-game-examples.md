# Game Examples

There are built-in examples to demonstrate what types of games you can build with Pax Consola.

## Example: Snake

This game is based directly on easyforth.com which has a great tutorial for getting introduced to 
Forth.

Snake is a perfect example game because it can run in-memory even when all functions are inlined,
but all optimizations are turned off. This can result in a binary too large to run on some systems.
Meanwhile, the game is still easy to customize as a starter game.
